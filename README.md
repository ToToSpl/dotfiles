# DOTFILES
This is my set of dotfiles for Ubuntu.

## Requirements
As of now this is configured for this programs:
 - i3-gaps
 - nerd-fonts (for status bar)
 - alacritty (opengl/rust terminal)
 - picom (transparency)
 - pulseaudio
 - pasystray (audo toolbar)
 - nitrogen/feh (wallpaper)

## Licencing
Like all code this is also "borrowed" and then edited. Big thanks to:
 - [andreatta](https://github.com/andreatta) for i3status and i3 config
 - [atlas-ark](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/kcffkg/1920x1080_penguin_linux_wallpaper_dark_light_svg/) for lockscreen
 - [JANAKA](https://4kwallpapers.com/gradients/macos-monterey-stock-orange-light-layers-5k-5894.html) for wallpaper
